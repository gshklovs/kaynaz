### Objectives
- Create a professional, trustworthy, and welcoming website for a therapy practice.

- Clear service descriptions (Clinical Supervision, Therapy, Coaching & Consulting [temp]).
- Contact form that emails submissions with key metadata.
- Simple Blog system enabling admin to add new posts.
- Cohesive, calming visual style and copy suitable for mental health services.

### Audience & Tone
- Audience: Individuals seeking therapy, clinicians seeking supervision, referral sources.
- Tone: Compassionate, clear, reassuring, professional, and ethically grounded.

### Design Direction
- Colors: Calming blues and teals with warm neutrals (primary: #0E6BA8, accent: #1CA7A8, neutral: #F4F7F9, dark: #143642).
- Typography: Headings in a humanist serif (Lora), body in a clean sans-serif (Inter).
- Layout: Generous whitespace, readable line length, large touch-friendly buttons, clear section headings.
- Imagery: Gentle, nature-inspired illustrations; friendly portrait photography; avoid clinical sterility.
