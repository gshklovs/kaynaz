    <h2>Insurance & Fees</h2>
    <p>Many PPO plans reimburse for out‑of‑network behavioral health services. We encourage you to contact your insurance provider to ask:

        <li>What is my out‑of‑network deductible?</li>
        <li>What percentage is reimbursed for behavioral health services?</li>
      </ul>
      Upon request, we can provide a receipt (superbill) for you to submit.
    </p>
